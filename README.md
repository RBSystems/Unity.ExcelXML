# Unity.ExcelXML 
## Part of the open source Unity.Framework for Crestron

Crestron SIMPL# library for reading and writing Microsoft Xml Spreadsheet 2003 files. 

## License: Commercial Use Permitted (LGPL V3). In brief, under this license:
Please freely use this module in any Crestron application, including for-profit Crestron SIMPL Windows programs that you charge money to sell, and in SIMPL# libraries of your own, including ones you sell.

* You may freely use it as a referenced external library (just like you would use Newtonsoft/JSON.Net--this is called dynamic linking). This use does NOT require you to license your code as LPGL V3 or open source either your SIMPL Windows programs or your SIMPL# libraries.
* However (and there's no need to do this), if instead of linking to this as an external library (referencing the .dll in Visual Studio), you copy code from this library into your SIMPL# library (e.g. copy the .cs files into your project), then that entire library must be open sourced and licensed as LGPL V3 as well.
* Also if you make changes to the UnityExcelXml source (which you are free to modify in any way to make it more useful to you), those changes needs to be licensed as LGPL V3 as well and remain open source.
* Branching this reposity, and issuing a pull request back to this repository would be appreciated if you feel those changes will enhance the usability of this library to other Crestron programmers.
